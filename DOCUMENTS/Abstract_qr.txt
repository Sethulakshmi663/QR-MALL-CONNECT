Abstract 
The Smart Mall QR-Based Store Information System is a web-based digital platform 
developed to enhance the in-mall shopping experience by providing real-time access to store
related information through a single QR scan. This system addresses common shopper 
challenges, such as difficulty locating stores, finding specific products, or being unaware of 
current promotions. By scanning a QR code placed at key entry or intersection points within 
the mall, users are instantly directed to a centralized web application that displays all necessary 
details  including store names, product listings, prices, floor-wise locations, and special offers. 
At the heart of this system is a robust and scalable architecture built using modern web 
technologies. The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure 
responsiveness and interactivity, while the backend utilizes Python with Django for smooth 
data handling and secure server-side operations. An SQLite database manages the store and 
product information, ensuring fast and reliable access to dynamic content. The system supports 
core functionalities such as QR code scanning, search and filter options by floor or category, 
and a dedicated admin panel for updating store data and managing promotions. 
This platform not only improves navigation and decision-making for shoppers but also serves 
as a powerful tool for mall administrators to maintain up-to-date information and promote store 
visibility. By reducing the time and effort spent in physically locating products or offers, the 
system provides a more organized and engaging shopping journey. It also encourages the 
integration of digital tools in everyday environments, promoting smart infrastructure within 
commercial spaces. 
With emphasis on usability, real-time data access, and ease of maintenance, the Smart Mall 
QR-Based Store Information System is a forward-thinking solution aimed at transforming 
traditional mall visits into efficient, informed, and digitally enhanced experiences. As malls 
continue to grow in size and complexity, this system is designed to scale and adapt, making it 
a valuable asset for smart retail environments.
